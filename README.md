In this ship you will find all type of grab interactions implemented in the tool:

- Basic objects.
- Physical objects.
- Objects using custom joints and constraints.
- Multiple-hand grabs.
- Grabbables within grabbables.
- Locked grabbables.
- Hands that snap-back or that stay with the object.

And a long list of smaller tools and scripts (like reactive sounds, snap points or particle systems) in order to bring the whole scene into life!

Soon you will be able to download the full Demo on SideQuest. In the mean time, download this project and have a look for yourself, feedback is very welcomed and the scene will keep growing during 2021.
