# HandPosing_Demo

A Pirate demo for the HandPosing tool.
Download the tool package here: https://github.com/MephestoKhaan/HandPosing

In this ship you will find all type of grab interactions implemented in the tool:

- Basic objects.
- Physical objects.
- Physical object using a custom joint.
- Multi Grabs.
- Grabbables within grabbables.
- Hands that snap-back or that stay with the object.

And a long list of smaller tools and scripts (like reactive sounds or snap points) in order to bring the whole scene into life!!

Soon you will be able to download the full Demo on SideQuest. In the mean time, download this project and have a look for yourself, feedback is very welcomed and the scene will keep growing during 2021.
